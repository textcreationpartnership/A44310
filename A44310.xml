            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>As Touching my Conſcience.</head>
               <p>I Have been very diligent to keep my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Clean, to Incourage It in the Vicegerency that THOU, [the great <hi>LORD</hi> of the World] haſt given It over my Soul and Actions. I have kept It in the Throne and greateſt Reverence and Authority in my Heart.</p>
               <p>In Actions to be Done or Omitted, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Adviſed with It, and taken Its Adviſe; I have neither Stifled, nor Forced, nor Bribed It; but gave It a free Liberty to Adviſe and Speak out, and a free Subjection of my Will, Purpoſes, and Actions to It.</p>
               <p>If, through Importunity of Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have at any time done Amiſs, I have not taken Her up ſhort, or ſtopped Her Mouth, or my own Attention to Her Chiding and Reproof; but I have, with much Submiſſion of Mind, born Her Chaſtiſement, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it to an Humbling of my ſelf before THEE for my Failings; for I looked upon Her as Acting<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37617:3"/>by THY Authority, for THY Service, and to THY Glory; and I durſt not Diſcourage, Diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or Diſobey Her.</p>
               <p>When She was Pleaſed, and gave me Good Words I was Glad; for I eſteemed Her as a Glaſs that repreſented to my Soul the Favour or Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of GOD Himſelf, and how HE ſtood affected towards me.</p>
               <p>I have more Trembled under the Fear of a Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Diſcouraged Conſcience, than under the Fear of a Sharp or Scrupulous Conſcience? becauſe I always accounted the Latter, tho' more Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, yet more Safe.</p>
               <p>I have been very jealous, either of Wounding, or Grieving, or Diſcouraging, or Deadning my Conſcience. I have therefore choſen rather to forbear that which ſeemed but Indifferent, leſt there ſhould be ſome-what in it that might be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; and would rather Gratifie my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with being too Scrupulous, than Diſpleaſe, Diſquiet, or Flat It, by being too Venturous: I have ſtill choſen rather to Forbear what might be Probably Lawful, than to Do that which might be Poſſibly Unlawful; becauſe I could not Err in the Former, I might in the Latter.</p>
               <p>I have been careful to adviſe Impartially with my Conſcience before my Actions; But leſt I had commited any thing Amiſs, either in the Nature or Manner of the Action, I commonly, every Night, brought my Actions of the Day paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judicatory of my Conſcience, and left Her to a Free and Impartial Cenſure of them; and<pb facs="tcp:37617:3"/>what She Sentenced Well Done, I with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <head>Touching THY Creatures.</head>
               <p>I have not only looked upon THY Bleſſings and Bounty, in Lending me THY own Creatures for my Uſe; but I have ſought unto THEE for a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon them, in my Uſe of them.

               <p>I received and uſed THY Creatures, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me under a Truſt, and as a Steward and Accomptant for them; and therefore I was always careful to uſe them according to thoſe Limits, and in order for thoſe Ends, for which THOU didſt commit them to me: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> With Temperance and Moderation; I did not uſe THY Creatures to Luxury and Exceſs, to make Proviſion for my<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37617:4"/>Luſts, with vain Glory or Oſtentation, but for the convenient Support of the Exigencies of my Natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
